<h3>The Nightmare Before Christmas</h3>
<p>One of the best animated movies ever created. 
    Created fully in stop motion animation. 
    Everything is a 10/10, the music, the art direction, 
    the acting, the story. </p>

<h3>Inside LLewyn Davis</h3>
<p>A great movie by the Coen Brothers. 
    While most may not consider it their best in favour of 
    other greats like Fargo and the Big Lebowski, 
    Inside LLewyn Davis the Coen Brothers mastering their style. 
    For a story about seemingly nothing, it feels like they are 
    saying so much, and I think they are. On top of this, 
    it makes you wish you could travel to 1960s Greenwich village 
    and is reminiscent of a period piece, without all the hippies. 
    On top of this, the music is great, Oscar Isaac has a great 
    voice for folk, the art direction is moody without being a 
    caricature, and, the cat is cute.</p>
<p>10/10</p>

<h3>The Fellowship of the Ring</h3>
<p>The first installment in Peter Jackson's take on Tolkien's the 
    Lord of the Rings. This one establishes import places and 
    characters, while also driving the story forward and gaining 
    momentum as it keeps rolling. Every actor is great, and I 
    love that they had a great time making these films. The score 
    is impeccible. The costumes and scenery breathtaking. If this 
    movie doesn't make you fall in the love with the characters and 
    want to watch more of their journey then I feel sad for you and 
    you're wrong.</p>
